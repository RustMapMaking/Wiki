<h3>Vehicles in Rust</h3>
<p>

<p>Modular Cars are here</p>
<p>Car Locks</p>
<p>Larger map size 4500 instead of 4250 to accomodate larger number of vehicles</p>
<p>With introduction of heli vendors you will no longer see small helis along the roads, this will be replaced with modular cars that need to be fixed.</p>

      <h3>FACTS</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Have limited Hit Points when you encounter them on the beach</li>
        <li>Need to be repaired ( using Wood & Metal Frags ) while inside a Boathouse with walls and ceiling ( Doors are not necessary i believe )</li>
        <li>When they are destroyed (0hp) you can no longer push/mount them, their model just sits there.</li>
         <li>Needs to be pushed (using 'E' key) into nearby water before you make it move</li>
        <li>Can be tipped over by player/waves</li>
        <li>Can be flipped upright be hopping on top and pressing 'E' key to attempt flipping of said boat (takes a bit of practice)</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>TIPS</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The easiest way to get LGF for your boat is to head to the lighthouse or nearby road and smash an Oil Barrel.  From there head to the ocean and gather further Oil Barrels.</li>
      </ul>
